IMUdata_Labview
===============

IMU data aquisition in labview. IMU-Accelerometer, Gyroscope. 

This code is written in labview and can be run in the same only.

This includes the data acceptance from ATmega128 serially using usb to serial converter. The COM port was used in labview.

The data gives the angular position. It is obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope.

The 3-D plane orientation in labview demonstrates the angular postions given by the sensor serial data.
